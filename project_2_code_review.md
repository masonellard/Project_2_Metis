[X] README.md included
[X] Slides included
[X] Code included

## Clean Code:

- Code follows PEP-8
- Very readable and easy to follow
- Good job using different notebooks for each process(scrape,cleaning&engineering, and modeling.
  In future projects these can be moved to separate .py modules and imported. Also, try to create functions for processes that are repeated. 

## Good Documentation:

- Good & informative README.md
- Use markdown cells at beginning of .ipynb to explain scope and analyis
- Could use more markdown cells throughout as section headings to explain data science concepts and decisions made (you did it for some sections)
- Be sure to include a "results" section in your README in the future -- just a quick high-level overview of your key takeaways!



## Proper Data Science:

- Great job using advanced modeling topic for the first project.
- Be careful scaling data. Fit_transform only on training data not on test (just transform)


## Comments:

- Great job on project 2! :)
- Love the approach/project design of writer,director,and cast rank
- Great work on the streamlit app
